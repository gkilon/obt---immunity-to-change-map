לא נמצא מפתח Gemini API במשתני הסביבה.
כדי לתקן זאת (בצורה מאובטחת):
1. צור קובץ .env בתיקייה הראשית.
2. הוסף את השורה: API_KEY=העתק_כאן_את_המפתח_שלך
3. התחל מחדש את השרת (npm start).

הנה ניתוח לדוגמה שהיית מקבל:
המפה שלך מראה התחלה טובה. הפער הלוגי המרכזי נמצא בין טור 2 (התנהגויות) לטור 3 (דאגות).
שאלת מפתח: האם הדאגה שציינת בטור 3 היא באמת הדבר הכי גרוע שיקרה אם תפסיק את ההתנהגות בטור 2?`;
